# Responsive Table

After looking at some [good](http://codyhouse.co/demo/pricing-tables/)
[examples](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/) of responsive
tables around the web, I decided to share my take on them.

This repo was built from the ground up, stripping all the eye candy CSS to a
separate file and keeping the bare essential CSS to bestow responsiveness into
a table into a different file.
